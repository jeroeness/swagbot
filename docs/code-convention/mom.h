// [SFT]tech coding guidelines
// ---------------------------
//
// please also have a look at `mom.cpp`
// to make the code look nice and be readable:
//  * sort things alphabetically.
//  * align things beautifully
//  * if you write documentation correctly, then:
//    * it's parsable by Doxygen
//    * -> cool generated docs!
//  * look at the following example code
//  * look at the "mom.cpp" file for a implementation example.

#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>

// Try to keep the code < 120 chars in width (no hard limit...)
// All documentation is in the header
// No swearing in comments!

// No preprocessor shit crap!

// Doxygen will then generate nice shiny documentation files.
// Exported (API) documentation of all source code is in the header file:

/**
 * You may document a namespace if it's something special.
 * This documentation will also show up in generated docs then.
